## DockerRecipe for Apache Marmotta

WIP

Tried other docker files for Apache Marmotta without success:
* http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/marmotta-commits/201504.mbox/%3C7675b784836c4685965daac23d2900bd@git.apache.org%3E
* https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/nicholsn/docker-marmotta/

Main reason was the weird configuration for Marmotta with regards to permissions, and the credentials needed to be disabled when first installed, for an admin user to be properly set up.
